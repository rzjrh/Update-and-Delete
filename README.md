# Update-and-Delete
we will making an API and update, and delete data from our data base 

Also, we need to add these dependencies before start to coding and when create new spring starter project:

spring web services
JPA
MySQL
DevTools

it is needed to create an schema in MySQL workbench and named as "book-schema"
make sure you have mysql server or MAMP server is on while running this project to see the updates in MySQL workbench 
you need "PostMan" to do the Get, Post, and Delete requsts on the server

Good Luck!
